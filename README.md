# btalllights-web
Web page that displays all lights and their statuses for Bticino MyHome system

This was made for a customer that required seeing all lights in the house and their statuses. He had problems with kids leaving lights on.

This would be helpful for large houses.

This is frontend for the "btalllights" background service.
